- Usage

For anything you want to flash/move to system: You will have to first make a folder inside the system folder for ex
You want to push a lib in lib64 folder for that you need to create a folder as 'lib64' inside the system folder
so the path will be : (flashable zip)/system/lib64/(your file)
Lets say :-

For Apps:
(flashable zip)/system/app/(your app)

For Fonts:
(flashable zip)/system/fonts/

For Boot anim:
(flashable zip)/system/media/(bootanimation.zip
